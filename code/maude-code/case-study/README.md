# Case Studies

To following files present very simple examples to understand the syntax of
_ccReact_ and the Maude's commands that can be used to verify some properties
of the model:

- `example1.maude` (Example 1 in the [paper](../paper.pdf)
- `simple-example2.maude`
- `simple-example.maude`

The case study considering the three different kinds of breast cancer,
identified as BT474, HCC1954, and SKBR3 can be found in the files with the same
name for the sort-term experiments and with the suffix `-ext` for the long-term
experiments. In the end of each of the following Maude's file, different
queries using the command `search` and `umaudemc` for LTL/CTL model checking
can be found. Some of these queries are explained in the [paper](../paper.pdf):

- `BT474-ext.maude`
- `BT474.maude`
- `HCC1954-ext.maude`
- `HCC1954.maude`
- `SKBR3-ext.maude`
- `SKBR3.maude`


The file `XXXXX` contains a further example taken from [1]



Finally, the file `XXXX` shows how the CTL queries in the case study considered
in XXX can be reproduced within our framework.
