\section{Experimentation}\label{sec:experiments}

Here we consider 
three larger case studies whose RS specifications have already appeared in the recent literature. For each case study, we briefly describe its main features and then show how the methodology outlined in the previous sections can be applied for carrying out some fruitful experimentation with \GROOVE.

All \GROOVE experiments were carried out on a Dell Precision 3551 laptop with an Intel i7 CPU running at 2.6 GHz; \GROOVE was run in a Java~24 JVM with 12GB of memory. No attempt was made to measure running time with precision, and repeated experiments have shown that the reported durations can deviate up to 10\%.
