\section{Introduction: TEXT TAKEN FROM RS2024 ABSTRACT}

We explore the capabilities of  a state-of-the-art toolset based on graph transformation  to perform reachability and causal analysis of Reaction Systems.

Reaction systems (RS)~\cite{DBLP:journals/fuin/EhrenfeuchtR07} are a computational model inspired by the functioning of biochemical reactions within living cells. 
%The primary motivation behind RS is to provide a simple yet expressive model for understanding and analyzing processes in natural and artificial systems.
RS focus on the interaction of entities through a set of reactions. 
Each reaction relies on some reactants, inhibitors, and products to mimic two fundamental mechanisms found in nature: facilitation and inhibition.
%Facilitation means that a reaction can occur only if all of its reactants are present, while inhibition means that a reaction cannot occur if any of its inhibitors is present. 
At each time instant, the next state of the system is determined by the products of all enabled reactions plus some additional entities that are possibly provided by environment.
Unlike traditional models of concurrency, like Petri nets, the theory of RS is based on three principles: \emph{no permanency}, any entity vanishes unless it is sustained by a reaction; \emph{no competition}, an entity is either available for all reactions, or it is not available at all; and \emph{no counting}, the exact concentration level of available entities is ignored.
Recent applications concerned, e.g., with the efficacy of medical treatments for comorbidities and with the selection of the best environment to achieve some desired phenomena, led to experiment with environments that exhibit nondeterministic and recursive behaviour.
Then, performing reachability and causal analysis required the exploration of large state spaces for which the available prototype tool~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/BrodoBF21} struggled in terms of  memory consumption and response time.
 
Graph Transformation (GT)~\cite{DBLP:series/eatcs/EhrigEPT06,DBLP:books/sp/HeckelT20} is a modelling technique that is widely applicable in problem domains where the objects of study have an inherent graphical structure, and the task at hand is to study their properties and evolution. Besides the graphs themselves, the core concept is that of a (transformation) \emph{rule} capturing a particular change to such a graph. Rules can be used, for instance, to describe the change of a system over time, but can also be instrumental in composing and decomposing graphs and so exposing structural properties.

Importantly for the utility of the technique, there are a number of (academic) tools supporting its use. The research described here crucially relies on \href{https://groove.cs.utwente.nl}{GROOVE}~\cite{DBLP:journals/sttt/GhamarianMRZZ12}, one of the most prominent tools in this area, which was designed precisely to enable GT-based system analysis of the kind described above. Two features of GROOVE that are essential for the purpose of this research are
\begin{enumerate}%[label=\emph{(\roman*)}]
\item nested (i.e., quantified) rules, which capture simultaneous changes in all neighbourhoods that satisfy certain application conditions, rather than only locally in one such neighbourhood at a time; and
\item exploration of the set of reachable graphs (under the given rules) using various strategies.
\end{enumerate}

We are in the process of investigating how GT can help in addressing the analysis questions in Reaction Systems. For this purpose, we encode a given RS as a single graph, upon which a small number of (fixed) rules operate to simulate the correct semantics. The core rule describes the simultaneous firing of all \blab{Reaction}s of which no \lab{inhibitor}s and all \lab{reactant}s are present; the firing results in the presence of all \lab{product}s. Simultaneously, all currently present \blab{Entity}s are removed. In GROOVE syntax, this looks as follows:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.40]{react}
\end{center}

To parse this, note that (in the GROOVE rule syntax) the red structure must be absent for the rule to apply; moreover, green labels are added and blue ones deleted upon rule application. The \ilab{present} flag signals whether an \blab{Entity} is considered to be currently present; hence, creating or deleting that flag comes down to creating or deleting the \blab{Entity}. The $\forall$-nodes impose the desired quantification, causing a single application of this rule to model the firing of all enabled \blab{Reaction}s, even if there are thousands of them.

Our model also supports environments that inject \blab{Entity}s in a controlled manner. This is achieved through a second rule, not shown here. A configuration is reachable if it can be constructed by the alternating application of both rules.

\medskip\noindent
Our first results are encouraging: GROOVE seems capable to explore larger Reaction Systems 
%is well beyond what other tools have been able to achieve, 
by halving the analysis time of both reachability and causal analyses.
More precisely, we are able to find a trace towards unwanted patterns (if they exist) among millions of reachable configurations using different heuristics; then, we can also prune the trace to extract a graphical representation of the causal history of that entities, at least as far as reactants are concerned.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Reaction Systems with Guarded Contexts}

First, we briefly account for the classical set theoretic definition of Reaction Systems (RSs)~\cite{DBLP:journals/fuin/EhrenfeuchtR07}. Then, we focus on their process algebraic version~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/BrodoBF21} and its further extension with guarded contexts in~\cite{DBLP:conf/cmsb/BowlesBBFGM24}.


\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{RS basics.}
A Reaction System~\cite{DBLP:journals/fuin/EhrenfeuchtR07} is a pair ${\cal A} = (S, A)$, where $S$ is the finite set of \emph{entities}, and $A$ is a finite set of \emph{reactions}, i.e., triples of the form $a = (R,I,P)$, where $R, I, P\subseteq S$ and $R \cap I = \emptyset$. 
The sets $R, I, P$ are the sets of \emph{reactants}, \emph{inhibitors}, and  \emph{products}, respectively. 
Without loss of generality, we admit the use of empty sets as reactants or inhibitors.
%
Given the current state $W\subseteq S$, a reaction $a = (R,I,P)$ is enabled in $W$ if all its reactants are present (i.e., $R\subseteq W$) and all its inhibitors absent (i.e., $W \cap I = \emptyset$).
The \emph{result} of the reaction $a$ on the current state $W$ is defined by letting
$
\mathit{res}_a(W) \triangleq\;
P$ if $a$ is enabled, and
$\mathit{res}_a(W) \triangleq\; \emptyset$ otherwise.
The result of all reactions $A$ on the current state $W$, is $\mathit{res}_A(W) \triangleq \cup_{a \in A} \mathit{res}_a(W)$.

The no-permanency principle of RSs dictates that entities disappear if not sustained by some reaction.
Thus, the current state $W=D\cup C$ is determined by the result $D$ of all reactions on the previous state, together with additional entities $C$ provided by the \emph{context}. 

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Process algebraic RSs and guarded contexts.}
Inspired by Plotkin's Structural Operational Semantics (SOS) approach~\cite{DBLP:journals/jlp/Plotkin04a} and process algebras such as CCS~\cite{Milner80}, the key features of the process algebraic version of RSs, are the ability to account for a quite general notion of context (guarded, nondeterministic, recursive) using a friendly syntax and a compositional approach. This way, we derive a Labelled Transition System (LTS) semantics for RSs by means of inductive inference rules, where LTS states are terms of an algebra, each transition defines a computation step of the RS and its label records the entities involved in that step.

\begin{definition}[RS processes]\label{def:LTSforRS}
%Let $S$ be a set of entities. 
\emph{RS processes} are defined by the grammar below:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathsf{P} & := & [\mathsf{M}]
\\
\mathsf{M} & := & (R,I,P) \mid D \mid \mathsf{K} \mid \mathsf{M}|\mathsf{M}
\\
\mathsf{K} & ::= & \nil \mid (R,I,C).\mathsf{K} \mid \mathsf{K}+\mathsf{K} \mid X
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent
where $R$, $I$, $P$, $C$, and $D$ are sets of entities (with $P\neq \emptyset$ and $R\cap I=\emptyset$) and $X$ is a context identifier drawn from a family of (recursive) definitions $\Delta \triangleq\{X_j=\mathsf{K}_j\}_{j\in J}$, called the \emph{environment}.
\end{definition}

Roughly, a RS process  $\mathsf{P}$ embeds a \emph{mixture} process $\mathsf{M}$ obtained as the parallel composition of some reactions $(R,I,P)$, some available entities $D$ (if any), and some \emph{context} process $\mathsf{K}$.
%We write $\prod_{i\in I} \mathsf{M}_i$ for the parallel composition of all $\mathsf{M}_i$ with $i\in I$. 
A  context process $\mathsf{K}$ is either: 
the nil context $\nil$ that stops the computation;
the guarded context $(R,I,C).\mathsf{K}$ that makes the entities $C$ available to the reactions if the reactants $R$ are present and the inhibitors $I$ are absent, and then will behave as $\mathsf{K}$ at the next step;
the non-deterministic choice $\mathsf{K}_1+\mathsf{K}_2$ that can behave as either  $\mathsf{K}_1$ or $\mathsf{K}_2$;  
the context identifier $X$ that behaves as $\mathsf{K}$ for $X=\mathsf{K}\in \Delta$.
We write $C.\mathsf{K}$ as a shorthand for the trivially guarded process $(\emptyset,\emptyset,C).\mathsf{K}$.


We say that $\mathsf{P}$ and $\mathsf{P}'$ are structurally equivalent, written $\mathsf{P} \equiv \mathsf{P}'$, when they denote the same term up to the laws of Abelian monoids (unit, associativity and commutativity) for  parallel composition $\cdot | \cdot$, with $\emptyset$ as the unit, and the laws of idempotent Abelian monoids for choice $\cdot +\cdot$, with $\nil$ as the unit. We also assume $D_1 | D_2 \equiv D_1\cup D_2$ for any $D_1,D_2\subseteq S$.

The SOS semantics of  RS processes is defined by the SOS rules in Fig.~\ref{fig:guardforRS2nd}.
A transition label $\ell$, written $\obs{\obs{D}{R',I',C}}{R,I,P}$, records:
the available entities $D$; the entities $C$ provided by the guarded contexts, assuming all entities in $R'$ are present and those in $I'$ are absent;
the set $R$ of entities whose presence enables or disables some reactions;
the set $I$ of entities whose absence  enables or disables some reactions;
and the set $P$ of reaction products.
The  rules guarantee that, whenever $\mathsf{P}\xrightarrow{\obs{\obs{D}{R',I',C}}{R,I,P}} \mathsf{P}'$, it holds that $(R',I',C)$ is enabled in $D$ and that
$(R,I,P)$ is enabled in $W\triangleq (D\cup C)$.

\end{array}$$
		\caption{SOS semantics of the RS processes.}
		\label{fig:guardforRS2nd}
\end{figure*}


The rule $(\textit{Ent})$ records the set of current entities $D$.
By rule $(\textit{Cxt})$, a prefixed context process $C.\mathsf{K}$ makes available the entities in $C$ and then reduces to $\mathsf{K}$. 
Rules $(\textit{Suml})$ and $(\textit{Sumr})$ select a move of either the left or the right context, resp., discarding the other process.
By rule $(\textit{Rec})$, a context identifier $X$ behaves according to its defining process $\mathsf{K}$.
The rule $(\textit{Pro})$ assumes the reaction $(R,I,P)$ is enabled: it records its reactants, inhibitors, and products in the label, and leaves the reaction  available at the next step, together with its products $P$.
The rule $(\textit{Inh})$ records in the label the reasons why the reaction $(R,I,P)$ should not be executed: possibly some inhibiting entities $(J \subseteq I)$ are present or some reactants $(Q \subseteq R)$ are missing, with $J \cup Q \neq \emptyset$, as at least one cause is needed.
The rule $(\textit{Par})$ puts two processes in parallel by pooling their labels and joining all labels components. We write $\ell_1\cup\ell_2$ for the component-wise union of labels:
%
{\footnotesize
\[
%\begin{array}{l}
\textstyle
\bigcup_{i=1,2} \obs{(D_i,C_i)}{R_i,I_i,P_i}
%\obs{(D_1,C_1)}{R_1,I_1,P_1}
%\cup
%\obs{(D_2,C_2)}{R_2,I_2,P_2}\\
%\hspace{4.8cm}
\triangleq 
\obs{(D_1\cup D_2,C_1\cup C_2)}{R_1\cup R_2,I_1\cup I_2,P_1\cup P_2}\ .
%\end{array}
\]}


The sanity check $\ell_1\frown\ell_2$ is required to guarantee that labels of reactants and inhibitors are consistent (see definition below):
%
{\footnotesize
\[
%\begin{array}{l}
\obs{(D_1,C_1)}{R_1,I_1,P_1}
\frown
\obs{(D_2,C_2)}{R_2,I_2,P_2}
\triangleq
\textstyle (\bigcup_{i=1,2} D_i\cup C_i \cup R_i) \cap (I_1\cup I_2) = \emptyset .
%\\
%\hspace{5cm}\triangleq 
%(D_1\cup  D_2 \cup C_1 \cup C_2 \cup R_1 \cup R_2) \cap (I_1 \cup I_2) = \emptyset\ .
%\end{array}
\]
}


Finally, the rule $(\textit{Sys})$ checks that all the needed reactants are available in the system ($R \subseteq D\cup C$). Checking the absence of inhibitors  ($(D\cup C)\cap I = \emptyset$) is not necessary, thanks to the sanity check in rule $(\textit{Par})$.
%
%In the following we assume transitions $\mathsf{P}\xrightarrow{\obs{(D,C)}{R,I,P}} \mathsf{P}'$ guarantee that any instance of the rule $(\textit{Inh})$ is applied in a way that maximizes the sets $J$ and $Q$ (see~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/BrodoBF21}).
Notably, the SOS semantics matches the set-theoretic dynamics of RSs (as made precise by~\cite[Th.~19]{DBLP:journals/tcs/BrodoBF21}). 


%\begin{theorem}[cf.~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/BrodoBF21}]
%\label{the:corr}
%Let ${\cal A}$  be a RS, let $\pi=(\{C_i\}_{i\in[0,n]},\{D_i\}_{i\in[0,n]})$ an interactive process, and let
%$\mathsf{P}_i \triangleq \llbracket {\cal A},\pi \rrbracket_i$ for any $i\in[0,n]$.
%Then, for any $i\in[0,n-1]$:
%%both the following conditions hold:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%if $\mathsf{P}_i \xrightarrow{\obs{(D,C)}{R,I,P}} \mathsf{P}$
% then
%$D=D_i$, $C=C_i$, $P= D_{i+1}$ and
%$\mathsf{P} \equiv \mathsf{P}_{i+1}$;
%\item there exists
%$R,I \subseteq S$ such that 
%$\mathsf{P}_i \xrightarrow{\obs{(D_i,C_i)}{R,I,D_{i+1}}} \mathsf{P}_{i+1}$.
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{theorem}


The similarity with the syntax of reactions is intended: the key difference is that in $(R,I,C).\mathsf{K}$ the presence of reactants $R$ and the absence of inhibitors $I$ is checked w.r.t. the set of current entities $D$.
More importantly, the products $C$ are made available immediately from the context, not at the next step.
Note that a conditional prefixed process that is not enabled behaves as the $\nil$ process.





\begin{example}
The context 
\(
X = (\{\mathsf{a}\},\emptyset,\{\mathsf{b}\}).X + (\{\mathsf{b}\},\emptyset,\{\mathsf{a}\}).X + (\emptyset,\{\mathsf{a},\mathsf{b}\},\emptyset).X
\)
%\noindent
ensures that whenever $\mathsf{a}$ or $\mathsf{b}$ are present in the current state, then both $\mathsf{a}$ and $\mathsf{b}$ are available as reactants.
The last option $(\emptyset,\{\mathsf{a},\mathsf{b}\},\emptyset).X$ handles the case where the first two guards fail: if omitted, when both $\mathsf{a}$ and $\mathsf{b}$ are absent the context $X$ would behave as $\nil$, blocking the computation.
\end{example}
