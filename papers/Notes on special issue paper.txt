Outline of RS-with-GT paper
===========================

- External deadline: March 2025, Natural Computing
- Fix internal deadline: beginning of December


Extension with other studies:
----------------------------
- Comparison with Maude (talk bij Linda Brodo)
- T-Cell (Paolo Milazzo)
- Distributed Reaction Systems case (≈Åukasz Mikulski)

Main point of the paper
- Improving on existing analysis, from the point of 
  * View of performance
  * Outcome of the analysis

Paper outline
=============

Background
----------
- Reaction Systems, including guarded contexts
- Graph Transformation Systems
- In both cases: present "advanced" version

Toy example
-----------
- Coffee machine, ATM?

Encoding of RS in GT
--------------------
- Rules for implementing RS semantics
- Conversion of a trace to a control program
- Using recipes in the occurrence graph building

Comparison section
------------------
- BiRosesove
- Heresy
- WebRSim
- CL-RS (https://github.com/mnzluca/cl-rs)
- Maude
(See https://www.reactionsystems.org/about-reaction-systems)

Flexibility of encoding
-----------------------
- We can modify our system to other RS variants
- Do another (small) case study? Durations?


Action Points
=============
- Develop toy example
- Think about possible extensions
